## Our Aims & Our Goals

• To bring the community a realistic fleet of United Kingdom vehicles of different counties and agencies. Handcrafted lighting using a range of custom made components & skins made with love and care.

• To Redefine, Recreate and upping the standards of current vehicles, from the lighting setups right down to the skins. Giving them proper love, care and attention; to the realistic feeling that they deserve. 

• Aiming to provide models that have been forgotten and overlooked for far too long.

• Expanding the possibilities of a scene, from the ground vehicles to the skies. Giving you that edge over the suspects or transporting a critical patient to the hospital.

## Why?

**Why are we doing this?**
What an interesting question this is asked among the community and even the team itself quite frequently.

The reason we do this project is. We were tired and annoyed about how lacklustre and how uncared the vehicles in UK roleplay servers were. 
So we decided that we would step in and take control of the issue by forming "999Emergency", which once started as a small team of 4 people, quickly grow into 7 in the space of a week. 

We wanted people to look at our country with pride. Previously not possible to do beforehand; because of the quality and lack of realism of the content provided.

**Why the name "999Emergency"**

When we were creating this project, we wanted to name ourselves something that was rememberable. We decided to go with '999Emergency' for the following reasons.
"999" is the emergency service number in the United Kingdom.
"Emergency" 'a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.' 

When we started this project, we were only going to create Emergency vehicles from the United Kingdom; whilst we're only going to make UK content, we're not entirely bound to just Emergency services anymore.
